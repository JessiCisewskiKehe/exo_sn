{\bf Abstract}\\
% Context, Aims, Methods, Results, Conclu (not mandatory)
Stellar activity is one of the primary limitations to the detection of low-mass exoplanets using the radial-velocity (RV) technique. 
Stellar activity can be probed by measuring variations in the shape of the cross-correlation function (CCF) as a function of time often using different moments of a modeled CCF. Therefore estimating the moments of the CCF with high precision is essential to de-correlate exoplanet signals from spurious RV signals originating from stellar activity.
%
We propose to estimate the moments of the CCF by first fitting a model using a Skew Normal (SN) density shape, which unlike the commonly employed Normal density,  includes an asymmetry parameter to capture the natural asymmetry of the CCF induced by convective blueshift. \jessi{is convective blueshift the only asymmetry-inducing variable of the CCF?}
%
The performance of the proposed method is compared to the Normal density using both simulated and real observations with varying levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.
%We analyze 5 stars with different activity levels and whose CCF's have different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. In each case, we compare the results obtained by fitting to the CCF respectively a Normal and a SN.  We also estimate rigorous errors for the different moments of the CCF using a bootstrap analysis.
%
When considering the real observations, the correlation between the RV's and the asymmetry of the CCF and the correlation between the RV's and the width of the CCF are stronger when using the parameters derived from the SN than the Normal approach. 
This suggests that the CCF asymmetry and the CCF width derived using a SN may be more sensitive to stellar activity, which can be helpful with estimating stellar rotational periods and generally characterizing the stellar activity signals.
%
The estimated uncertainties in the estimated RV's using the proposed SN approach are on average $10\%$ smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the Normal, and the estimated uncertainties on the SN asymmetry parameter are on average $15\%$ smaller than the commonly used Bisector Inverse Slope Span (BIS SPAN) approach for estimating the asymmetry of the CCF. 
%
The derived benefits of using the proposed SN approach includes an asymmetry parameter along with several options for estimating the RV, while the Normal model only includes an RV estimate and requires a separate procedure for estimating the asymmetry.  Furthermore, the estimated uncertainties on the RV's and the asymmetry parameter are smaller in the SN setting.
%The correlation between the RV's and the asymmetry of the CCF and the correlation between the RV's and the width of the CCF are always stronger when using the parameters derived from the SN in the case of real observations. Therefore the CCF asymmetry and the CCF width derived using a SN are more sensitive to stellar activity, which allows to probe with a better precision stellar rotational periods, in addition to characterize more precisely stellar activity signals. The precision on the estimated set of RV's, derived using the median of the fitted SN distributions are on average $10\%$ smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the Normal. In addition, the uncertainties related to the asymmetry parameter derived from the SN are on average $15\%$ smaller than the ones calculated on the common Bisector Inverse Slope Span (BIS SPAN). We strongly encourage the use of the SN distribution rather than the Normal distribution, because this allows us to retrieve in one single fit the different moments of the CCF, because the derived moments better catch stellar activity signals and finally because the standard errors on the RV's and the the asymmetry parameter are smaller than the one estimated with the Normal fit.

\section{Introduction} \label{intro}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Goal of RV analysis}

When working with radial velocities (RV's), the main limitation to the detection of small-mass exoplanets is not anymore the precision of the instruments used, but the different noises induced by the stars we are observing \citep[][]{Dumusque:2017aa}. Indeed, stellar oscillations, granulation phenomena and stellar activity all induce RV signals \citep{Saar-1997b, Queloz-2001, Desort-2007, Dumusque-2011a, Dumusque-2016a} that are beyond the meter-per-second precision reached by the best high-resolution spectrographs. It is therefore mandatory to understand better stellar signals and to find ways to correct for them, if in the near future we want to detect or confirm an Earth-twin planet using the RV technique. This is even more true now that instrument like ESPRESSO \citep{Pepe-2014} and EXPRESS \citep{fischer2016state} should have the stability to detect such signals. However, if solutions are not found to mitigate the impact of stellar activity, the detection or confirmation of potential Earth-twins will be extremely challenging.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Stellar activity effect on CCF, Normal fit plus FWHM and BIS SPAN indicators}

Among the different stellar signals we are aware of, the one that is the most difficult to characterize and to correct for is the signal induced by stellar activity. Stellar activity is responsible for creating magnetic regions on the surface of stars, and those regions change locally the temperature and the convection, inducing spurious RV's variations \citep{Meunier-2010a, Dumusque-2014b}. In theory, it should be easy to differentiate between the pure Doppler-shift induced by a planet, that will shift the entire stellar spectrum and stellar activity, that modifies the shape of spectral lines and by doing so create a spurious shift of the stellar spectrum \citep{Saar-1997b,Hatzes-2002,Kurster2003,Lindegren-2003,Desort-2007,Lagrange-2010,Meunier-2010a,Dumusque-2014b}. However, on quiet GKM dwarfs, the main target for precise RV's measurements, stellar activity induce signals of a few \ms. This corresponds physically to variations smaller than 1/100th of a pixel on the detector.

To be able to measure such tiny variations, we average the information of all the lines in the spectrum by cross correlating the stellar spectrum with a synthetic \citep[][]{Baranne-1996,Pepe-2002a} or an observed stellar template \citep[][]{Anglada-Escude-2012}. The result of this operation gives us the cross-correlation function (CCF). To measure the Doppler-shift between different spectra and therefore to retrieve the RV's of a star as a function of time, we calculate the variations of the CCF barycenter. The barycenter is generally estimated by fitting a Normal distribution to the CCF and taking its mean. Variations in line shape between different spectra, which indicate the presence of signals induced by stellar activity, is measured by analysing the different moments of the CCF. Usually, the width of the CCF is estimated using the FWHM of the fitted Normal distribution, and its asymmetry using the the bisector inverse slope span \citep[BIS SPAN,][]{Queloz-2001}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Why FWHM and BIS SPAN important?}

If a RV signal is induced by activity, generally a strong correlation will be observed between the RV and chromospheric activity indicators like \logrhk\,or H-$\alpha$ \citep{Boisse-2009,Dumusque-2012,Robertson-2014}, but also between the RV and the FWHM of the CCF or its BIS SPAN \citep[][]{Queloz-2001,Boisse-2009,Queloz-2009,Dumusque-2016a}. It is therefore common now, that when fitting for a planetray signal, in addition to a Keplerian, the model includes in addition linear dependancies with the \logrhk, the FWHM and the BIS SPAN \citep{Dumusque:2017aa,Feng:2017aa}. It is also common to add a Gaussian process to the model to account for the correlated noise induced by stellar activity. The hyperparameters of the Gaussian process are generally trained on the different activity indicators \citep{Haywood-2014,Rajpaul-2015}. It is therefore essential for mitigating stellar activity to obtain activity indicators that are the most correlated to the RV's but also for which we can obtain the best precision.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Figueira indicators of stellar activity + other}
Several works have derived indicators that are more sensitive to line asymmetry than the BIS SPAN. In \citet{Boisse-2011}, the authors develop $V_{span}$, a new indicator to derive the CCF asymmetry that is more sensitive than the BIS SPAN at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). \citet{Figueira-2013} studied the use of two new indicators, bi-Gauss and $V_{asy}$. The authors were able to show that when using bi-Gauss, the amplitude in asymmetry is 30\% larger, therefore allowing the detection of smaller-amplitude correlations with RV's variations. They also demonstrated that $V_{asy}$ seems to be the best indicator of line asymmetry at high SNR, as its correlation with RV is more significant than any other asymmetry indictors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Why using a SN distribution?}
In all the methods described above, the RV and the FWHM are derived using a Normal distribution fitted to the CCF, and the asymmetry is estimated using another approach. 

In this paper we propose to use a Skew Normal (SN) distribution to derive at the same time the RV, the FWHM and the asymmetry of the CCF, as this function includes a skewness parameter \citep[][]{Azzalini1985}. In addition, we know that for solar-type stars and cooler dwarfs, the bisector of the CCF as a "C"-shape due to convective blueshift \citep{Dravins-1981, Gray-2009}. Therefore, fitting the CCF using a model that naturally includes an asymmetry, like the SN distribution, should give in principle more precise results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Outline of paper}
The paper is organized as follow. In Sec.~\ref{sec:2} we introduce the SN distribution and describe its applicability for modeling the CCF,  showing that the SN distribution is a better representation of observed CCF than a Normal distribution, and study how the SN parameters relate to the RV, FWHM and BIS SPAN of the CCF. In Sec.~\ref{sec:31} we present a simple model to correct from stellar activity which extends the ones previously proposed \citep{Dumusque:2017aa,Feng:2017aa}. In Sec.~\ref{sec:soap} we study the SN fit to the CCF using simulations coming from SOAP 2.0. In Sec.~\ref{sec:4}, we compare on real observations the sensitivity of the SN parameters to stellar activity with respect to other existing indicators. In Sec.~\ref{sec:5} we derive error bars for the different CCF moments and finally we discuss our results and conclude in Sec.~\ref{sec:discu} and Sec.~\ref{sec:conclu}.

\section{The Skew Normal distribution} \label{sec:2}

The Skew Normal (SN) distribution is a class of probability distributions which includes the Normal distribution as a special case \citep{Azzalini1985}. The SN distribution has, in addition to a location and a scale parameter analogous to the Normal distribution's mean and standard deviation, a third parameter which describes the skewness of the distribution. Considering a random variable $Y\in \mathbb R$ (where $\mathbb R$ is the real line) which follows a SN distribution with location parameter $\xi \in \mathbb R$, scale parameter $\omega \in \mathbb R^{+}$ (i.e., the positive real line), and skewness parameter $\alpha \in \mathbb R$, its density at some value $y\in Y$ can be written as 
\begin{equation} \label{def:snd_gen}
SN(y;\xi, \omega, \alpha) = \frac{2}{\omega} \phi\left(\frac{y-\xi}{\omega}\right) \Phi\left(\frac{\alpha(y-\xi)}{\omega}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ and $\Phi$ are respectively the density function and the distribution function of a standard Normal distribution\footnote{A standard Normal distribution is a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.}.
The skewness parameter $\alpha$ quantifies the asymmetry of the SN. 
Examples of SN densities under different skewness parameter values and the same location and scale parameters ($\xi = 0$ and $\omega = 1$) are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:SN.plot}.  A usual Normal distribution is the special case of the SN distribution when the skewness parameter $\alpha$ is equal to zero\footnote{This can be seen from Eq.~\ref{def:snd_gen}. If $\alpha = 0$ then $\Phi\left(\frac{\alpha(y-\xi)}{\omega}\right) = \Phi(0) = 0.5$ and therefore $SN(y;\xi, \omega, 0) = \frac{1}{\omega} \phi\left(\frac{y-\xi}{\omega}\right)$ which is the density or a Normal distribution. Note that $\Phi(0) = 0.5$ because $\Phi(0)$ is the the probability that a standard Normal random variable is less than or equal than 0.}.
%

Note that the solid black line has an $\alpha = 0$, making it a Normal distribution.}
   \label{fig:SN.plot}
\end{figure}
%
For reasons related to the interpretation of the parameters in Eq.~\ref{def:snd_gen} and computational issues with estimating $\alpha$ near 0, a different parametrization is used in this work, which is referred to as the \emph{centered parametrization} (CP).  This CP is much closer to the parametrization of a Normal distribution, as it uses a mean parameter $\mu$, a variance parameter $\sigma^2$ and a skewness parameter $\gamma$. In order to define the CP, we need to express the CP parameters $(\mu, \sigma^2, \gamma)$ as a function of $(\xi, \omega^2, \alpha)$. This can be done using the following relations:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:snd_cp}
\mu = \xi + \omega \beta, \quad \sigma^{2} = \omega^{2}(1-\beta^2), \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{2}(4-\pi) \beta^{3}\left(1-\beta^2\right)^{-3/2},
\end{equation}
%
where $\beta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}\right)$ \citep[e.g.][]{Arellano-2010}.

By using Eq.~\ref{eq:snd_cp}, the new set of parameters $(\mu, \sigma^2, \gamma)$ provides a more clear interpretation of the behavior of the SN distribution. For the $\alpha$ values used in Fig.~\ref{fig:SN.plot}, the corresponding values of ($\mu$, $\sigma^2$, $\gamma$) are displayed in Table~\ref{tab:cp_values}.  In particular, $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are the actual mean and variance of the distribution, rather than simply a location and scale parameter, and $\gamma$ becomes an variable that evaluate the skewness of the SN. 

Beyond the mean of the SN, we introduce a second location parameter that will be largely used in the analyses: the median. The median of the SN, and in general the median of an absolute continuous random variable, is defined as the value $m$ such that\footnote{We recall that when using a symmetric distribution such as the Normal distribution, the mean and the median are equivalent.}:
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:snmed}
\int_{-\infty}^{m} SN(y;\xi, \omega, \alpha) = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fitting the Skew Normal distribution to the CCF} \label{sec:3}

%The CCF represents the average shape of spectral lines and is expressed in flux as a function of radial-velocity.
To fit the CCF using a SN distribution, we use a least-squares algorithm and the following model:
%
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:3}
f_{CCF}(y_i) = \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{A} \times SN(y_i;\mu, \sigma^2, \gamma), \quad i = 1, \ldots, n
\end{eqnarray}
%
where C is an unknown offset fitting for the continuum of the CCF, A is the unknown contrast of the CCF and $\mu$, $\sigma^2$ and $\gamma$ are the mean, variance and skewness of the SN as defined is Sect. \ref{sec:2}.
The values $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ are the different values of the abscisse of the CCF, generally with the dimension of a velocity.

Since the CCF presents a natural asymmetry due the convective blueshift, the SN distribution should in principle better catch this aspect, together with other changes in asymmetry, with respect to fitting a Normal distribution. To initially check this intuition, we compared the CCF residuals after fitting a Normal and a SN distribution for 2 stars. The first star is Alpha Centauri b, whose CCF's have high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The second star is Corot-7, whose CCF's have low SNR. Fig.~\ref{fig:Residual.comparison} shows that the SN seems to be a slightly better model to explain the shape of the CCF.%, in particular as the SNR decreases.
%
\begin{figure*}[htbp]
   \centering
\includegraphics[height = 2.5in]{[1]HD128621Residuals.pdf} 
\includegraphics[height = 2.5in]{[1]LRa01_E2Residuals.pdf} 
   \caption{Comparison between the Normal (black circles) and the SN (red crosses) residuals using CCF's from the star Alpha Centauri b (left) and Corot-7 (right). When looking at the residuals corresponding to the center of the CCF, the SN fit leads to slightly better results for both stars.} %Moreover, as the SNR decreases, the SN distribution shows smaller residuals respect the Normal ones.}
    \label{fig:Residual.comparison}
\end{figure*}
%

When fitting a Normal distribution to the CCF, the mean of the fitted distribution is defined as the measured RV, the FWHM of the Normal distribution ($=2\sqrt(2\ln2)\sigma$) represents the width of the CCF and because the Normal distribution is symmetric, a  skewness parameter cannot be obtained directly from this fit. Such a parameter is generally obtain in a second step by calculating the BIS SPAN of the CCF \citep[see Sect. \ref{intro}, and e.g.][]{Queloz-2001}. When fitting a SN distribution, we define two indicators for the RV: the mean of the SN, defined as SN mean RV and the median of the SN, defined as SN median RV. We will discuss advantages and limits for both of these choices in Sec. \ref{sec:4} and Sec. \ref{sec:5}. We define the width of the SN, SN FWHM, in the same way as for the Normal distribution\footnote{Note that SN FWHM does not correspond to the width of the SN distribution at half maximum like in the Normal case.}, and finally the skewness of the CCF, SN GAMMA, is derived using the $\gamma$ parameter.

To test the strength of the correlation between the estimated RV's and the different indicators used to evaluate stellar activity, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient, which in its general form is defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
R (x,y)= \frac{cov(x,y)}{\sigma(x),\sigma(y)},
\label{eq:Pearson:corr}
\end{equation}
%
where $x$ and $y$ are two quantitative variables, $cov(x,y)$ indicates the covariance between $x$ and $y$, and $\sigma(x)$ and $\sigma(y)$ represent their standard deviations.  A $p-$value for the statistical test having null hypothesis $H_{0}: R=0$ is provided, along with a $95\%$ confidence interval for $R$ when needed.

\section{Radial Velocity correction function for stellar activity} \label{sec:31}

Exoplanets will only produce a variation in RV's induced by a pure Doppler-shift of stellar spectra. Stellar activity and in particular the presence of active regions on the photosphere of the star, on the contrary, does not produce a blueshift or redshift of the spectra, but creates spurious RV's signal by modifying the shape of the spectral lines. To track these changes in the shape of the line profile, the general approach consists in using the FWHM, the BIS SPAN or the indicators introduced by \citep{Figueira-2013}, which provide an information on the average width and asymmetry of the CCF. A strong correlation between the estimated set of RV's and one or more of these parameters provides an indication that the RV's are affected by stellar activity signals.

Because of the spurious variations in RV's caused by active regions, a crucial step of the entire analysis is to correct the initially estimated RV's in order to retrieve a set of RV's containing ideally only the possibly pure Doppler-shift coming from the exoplanets. In order to reach this goal, we propose to consider a linear combination of the RV's having as covariates the amplitude parameter A, the BIS SPAN (or $\gamma$), the FWHM (or SN FWHM) and the interaction between the BIS SPAN and the FWHM (or $\gamma$ and SN FWHM and the interaction between $\gamma$ and SN FWHM in the SN case). We propose the following function to correct the RV's from stellar activity:
%
\begin{equation}
RV_{\text{stellar activity}}= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} A + \beta_{2} \gamma + \beta_{3} \text{SN FWHM} + \beta_{4} (\gamma  \text{SN FWHM})+\epsilon,
\label{eq:RV:correction}
\end{equation}
%
where $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept and $\epsilon$ is the vector of the errors with mean equal to $0$ and covariance matrix equal to $\sigma^{2}I$ ($I$ defined as the identity matrix). 

While the parameters BIS SPAN and FWHM have already been introduced and used in \citep{Dumusque:2017aa,Feng:2017aa}, by using Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction} we propose also to include the contrast parameter $A$ and a variable that quantifies the interaction between BIS SPAN (or $\gamma$) and FWHM (or SN WHM). The inclusion of the contrast parameter $A$ is justified by the fact that the presence for instance of a spot produces also changes in the amplitude of the CCF and not only on its asymmetry or width \citep[see e.g. Fig. 2 in ][]{Dumusque-2014b}.
%%

%   \caption{The presence of a spot on the photosphere of a star produces changes on the amplitude of the CCF (also known as contrast) and not only on its asymmetry or width. This very same plot has been originally presented by \citep{Dumusque-2014b} when introducing the Spot Oscillation And Planet (SOAP) 2.0 simulator.}
%    \label{fig:spotA}
%\end{figure*}
%%

The reasons for including in Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction} a variable that quantifies the interaction between BIS SPAN (or $\gamma$) and FWHM (or SN FWHM) will be better justified through the results of the examples presented in Sec.\ref{sec:soap}. We point out however that while the association between in this case BIS SPAN  (or $\gamma$) and FWHM (or SN FWHM) means that the values of one variable relate to the values of the other (since in this case we have two quantitative variables we talk about correlation), with the term interaction we mean that the effect that one variable has on the RV's is not constant. In particular the effect differs at different values of the other values. %As a consequence of this, if two variables are interacting the may or may not be associated.

In order to show the goodness of this correction, a statistical test on the parameters $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$, $\beta_{3}$ and $\beta_{4}$ is presented, where the null hypothesis is $H_{0}: \beta_{i}=0$, for $i=0,\dots,4$. The level for not rejecting the null hypothesis is fixed equal to $0.05$. The coefficient of multiple correlation $R^2$ is introduced in order to explain how well this linear combination addresses the variability of the RV variation induced by stellar activity. 

As final remark we recall that, when working with a linear regression, there are several ways to select the variables to include in the model. While usually the stepwise technique takes place \citep{efroymson1960multiple,hocking1976biometrics}, the proposed function defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction} that corrects from stellar activity is the result of statistical and astronomical considerations. In particular we checked that the correlations between the proposed parameters were not approaching one: if it were the case, the matrix needed to calculate the estimates would have been singular, hence non invertible. This problem is known in statistic with the term multicollinearity. A detailed discussion of the topic can be found in the book by \citep{belsley1991}. In the literature there are examples of stars presenting a high correlation between the contrast parameter $A$ and the FWHM \citep{Dumusque:2017aa,Feng:2017aa}. In the analyses of the presented work, we did not find any correlation between the contrast parameter $A$ and the FWHM (or between the contrast parameter $A$ and the SN FWHM) exceeding $0.66$ for all the analyzed stars and therefore the problem of multicollinearity is avoided. For the interpretation of the coefficients, we centered on the mean all the variables considered in the linear regression defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction}. Last, when proposing interactions between covariates, we found that only the one between the width and the asymmetry of the CCF is statistically helpful to explain spurious variations in RV's caused by stellar activity. Consequently, in the present work, the interaction between other variables are not used as covariates.

\section{Simulation Study} \label{sec:soap}
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed SN approach for modelling the CCF and the benefit of using the proposed correction for stellar activity (See Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction}), we begin by considering a simulation study using spectra generated from the Spot Oscillation And Planet (SOAP) 2.0 code \citep{Dumusque-2014b}.

\subsection{Faculae} \label{sec:soap.faculae}

\umberto{Specify characteristic of the faculae.}\xavier{}

Fig.~\ref{fig:faculae} shows the results obtained when a faculae is present on the photosphere of the star. It is possible to note that, although there is not a planet, the presence of the faculae leads to spurious variations in RV's for all the proposed indicators. SN mean RV seems to have the smallest spurious variations caused by the faculae. 

Since in this case we know that the variations in RV are only caused by the faculae, the evaluation of the correlations between the set of RV's and the asymmetry parameters can provide relevant information to understand the cause of the variations observed in RV's. Fig.~\ref{fig:faculae.corr} shows the correlations obtained using as RV respectively SN mean RV, SN median RV and RV. The $\gamma$ parameter shows a correlation with SN median RV equal to $-0.944$, which is stronger than the correlations between the other asymmetry indicators and their estimated RV's. When focusing on the width of the CCF, The correlation between SN FWHM and SN mean RV is the strongest one ($R^{2}=0.655$).

    \label{fig:faculae.corr}
\end{figure*}

Since all the variations in RV's displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:faculae} are caused by the presence of a faculae on the photosphere of the star, we corrected the originally estimated set of RV's by using Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction}. The results of the correction are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:faculae.correction} and the statistical tests on the parameters involved in Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction} are summarized in Table \ref{table:faculae.test}. It is straightforward noticing that the proposed correction almost completely addresses the issue, providing a new set of RV's where there are not anymore spurious variations caused by the presence of the faculae. In particular the $R^{2}$ is extremely high regardless the fit that has been use (Normal or SN). We note also that the parameter $\beta_{4}$, associated with the interaction between $\gamma$ and SN FWHM (or BIS SPAN and FWHM) is not statistically significant to explain spurious variations caused by a faculae.

\subsection{Spot} \label{sec:soap.spot}

\umberto{Specify characteristic of the spot.}\xavier{}

Fig.~\ref{fig:spot} shows the results obtained when a spot is present on the photosphere of the star. Similarly to the previous case, the presence of the spot leads to spurious variations in RV's for all the proposed indicators, but SN mean RV seems to have the smallest ones. We note however that in this case all the three indicators are similarly effected by the spurious changes in RV's caused by the spot.

Fig.~\ref{fig:spot.corr} shows the correlations between the asymmetry parameters and respectively SN mean RV, SN median RV and RV. The correlation between $\gamma$ and SN median RV is equal to $-0.89$ while the correlation between $\gamma$ and SN median RV is equal to $-0.82$. Both these correlations are stronger than the correlation between the BIS SPAN and RV ($R^2=-0.77$). The correlations between the width of the CCF and the corresponding RV's are slightly stronger when fitting a SN rather than a Normal distribution, as shown in the left series of plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:spot.corr}. The results show anyway a correlation close to $0$ when focusing on the width of the CCF, suggesting that the presence of a spot on the photosphere of star leads to changes in the shape of the CCF rather than its width.

Also in this case the proposed correction almost completely addresses the issue, providing a new set of RV's where there are not anymore spurious variations caused by the presence of the spot. The $R^{2}$ is extremely high regardless the fit that has been use (Normal or SN). The main differences respect to the previous case are that the parameter $\beta_{3}$, associated with $\gamma$, and the parameter $\beta_{4}$, associated with the interaction between $\gamma$ and SN FWHM (or BIS SPAN and FWHM), are statistically significant to explain spurious variations caused by a spot. This information could be useful in the future for disentangle spots from facuale.

\subsection{Spot and planet} \label{sec:soap.spot.planet}

The last presented simulation example consists in having not only spurious variations in RV's caused by the presence of a spot on the photosphere of the star but also a pure Doppler-shift because of an artificially injected planet. The purpose of this example is to check if we are able to disentangle the two different sources of variations in the set of RV's.

Fig.~\ref{fig:spot.plus.planet} shows the results obtained when a spot is present on the photosphere of the star and a planet is injected. The planet, having an amplitude of 10 \ms, produces a pure Doppler-shift on the CCF, without further changing its shape.  In this case N mean RV seems to have the largest variations caused by the combined action of spot and planet. %The evaluation of the standard errors leads to the same conclusions reported for the two previous cases: SN mean RV has the largest related uncertainties and the standard errors associates with SN median RV are $10 \%$ smaller than the standard errors derived for RV.

Fig.~\ref{fig:spot.plus.planet.corr} shows the correlations between $\gamma$ and respectively SN mean RV and SN median RV and the correlation between BIS SPAN and RV. In this case the correlations are weaker than the ones derived when only a spot is present on the photosphere of the star. Anyway the $\gamma$ parameter shows a correlation with the median SN of $-0.433$, which is stronger than what the correlation between the other asymmetry indicators and their corresponding RVs. The correlations between the width of the CCF and the corresponding RV's are comparable and, similarly to the previous case, close to $0$.

The correlations between the RVs and the width parameter of the CCF is weaker than the previous case that considers only the presence of a spot on the photosphere of the star.}
    \label{fig:spot.plus.planet.corr}
\end{figure*}

In order to correct the estimated set of RV's from spurious variations caused by the spot, we need to generalize Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction}, in order to consider also the possibly presence of an exoplanet. Hence, rather than just using Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction} we add the following keplerian function, which represents the pure Doppler-shift of the exoplanet under the assumption of circular orbit:
%
\begin{equation}
RV_{\text{exoplanet}}= K \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{P} (t - t_{0})\right),
\label{eq:RV:correction.planet}
\end{equation}
%
where the amplitude $K$, the orbital period $P$ and the epoch at the periapsis $t_{0}$ are three unknown parameters that define the presence of the exoplanet. Overall, the variations in RV's of the star can be defined as
%
\begin{equation}
RV= RV_{\text{stellar activity}} + RV_{\text{exoplanet}}.
\label{eq:RV:correction.overall}
\end{equation}
%

We note that the p--value associated with the amplitude parameter $K$ is particularly relevant for rejecting or not rejecting the assumption about the presence of an orbiting companion. Moreover we note also that Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction.planet} is highly non linear, meaning that the estimation of all the parameters involved in Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction.overall} has to be done numerically. %We used non linear least squares and the results are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:spotplanet.correction}. We can see how in this case we are able to disentangle the spurious variations in RV's caused by stellar activity from the pure Doppler-shift due to the planet. 
The statistical tests conducted on the parameters, whose results are summarized in Table \ref{table:spotplanet.test}, are significant. We note in particular that the p--value associate to the amplitude parameter $K$ is $2e-16$. This result can be justify by the fact that the planet artificially injected has amplitude $K=10 \ms$.

\subsection{Conclusions on the simulation study} \label{sec:soap.conclusions}

In this Sec.\ref{sec:soap} we presented a first implementation of the SN fit to CCF, using the simulation environment SOAP. Before moving to real cases, where the analyses on five stars are presented, we need to provide further considerations. First of all, looking ad the analyses conducted with SOAP, it seems that the largest correlation between an asymmetry parameter and a set of RV's happens to be when respectively $\gamma$ and SN median RV are used. This is a bit surprising, since as the shape of the CCF changes, we expect SN median RV to be more robust than SN mean RV. \umberto{A possible justification of this ...}. As second, when searching for stellar activity by deriving the correlation between the set of RV's and either an asymmetry parameter or the width of the CCF, the latter leads to weaker and hence less conclusive results if the active region is a spot. When stellar activity is dominated by faculae, both the shape and the width of the CCF changes as the faculae evolves on the photosphere of the star. Related to these last two considerations, we note that the interaction between the asymmetry and the width of the CCF is useful to explain part of the variability in the RV's if the active region is a spot but not when it is a faculae. The proposed function to correct for stellar activity addressed high level of spurious variations in RV's caused by active regions. In particular, respect to other common linear interpolation, we proposed to use as covariates also the amplitude parameter of the CCF and the interaction between $\gamma$ and SN FWHM (or BIS SPAN and FWHM). As a consequence of using the interaction between the asymmetry and the width of the CCF, we note that the FWHM (or SN FWHM) becomes statistically not significant, while this is not the case if the interaction term is not involved in the linear regression. Finally, the correlations involving the common indicators (i.e. RV, FWHM and BIS SPAN) are systematically weaker than the correlations obtained by fitting the SN to the CCF, suggesting that this distribution could be helpful when searching for active regions. We recall moreover that all the quantities needed for conducting the analyses of the CCF are directly available by just fitting the SN.

%In Sec. \ref{sec:5} we will present the evaluation of the standard errors associated with the parameters estimated for all the three presented cases. This step will point out how SN median RV minimizes the uncertainties respect using both SN mean RV and RV, therefore suggesting its use in order to properly define the set of RVs of the star.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Real data application} \label{sec:4}

In this Section we present the analyses conducted on Alpha Centauri b, comparing the result of fitting a CCF using the SN distribution defined in Sec. \ref{sec:3} with the approach based on the Normal distribution. Other four stars have been analyzed with the proposed method and details can be found in the Appendix \ref{appendix}. For all the stars that have been considered in the present work, we selected those CCF's having SNR larger than 10.

 A comparison with the results obtained by the classic approach is done, where the RV's of the star are estimated by retrieving the mean of the Normal distribution used to fit the CCF, along with the BIS SPAN or the other asymmetric parameters defined in \citet{Figueira-2013}. The latter parameters are calculated separately from the Normal fit that leads to the set of RV's of the star.

\subsection{Alpha Centauri B} \label{sec:alphacentb}

A total of $1808$ CCF's measured in $2010$ have been analysed from the star Alpha Centauri B. Several measurement in 2010 are contaminated by light from Alpha Centauri A. To remove contaminated spectra and thus CCF's, we performed the same selection as presented in \citet{Dumusque-2012}. Moreover, as noted in \citet{Dumusque-2012} and \citet{Thompson-2017}, this dataset presents a strong stellar activity signal.

We begin the analyses by evaluating the correlation between $\gamma$ and the BIS SPAN. In Fig.~\ref{fig:alphacent:corr.gamma}, we see that the relationship between $\gamma$ and the BIS SPAN is linear, with a slope equal to $0.72$ and a strong Pearson correlation coefficient of $0.954$. This comparison is useful because $\gamma$ is an adimensional parameter taking information about the asymmetry of the SN while the BIS SPAN, beyond this, has got unit of measure of \kms. In other words, by using Fig.~\ref{fig:alphacent:corr.gamma}, it is possible to provide a physical meaning to $\gamma$.
%

   \caption{Correlation between $\gamma$ and the BIS SPAN for Alpha Centauri B. Because $\gamma$ is adimensional, retrieving the slope between $\gamma$ and the BIS SPAN, which is expressed in \kms, allows us to provide physical meaning to $\gamma$.}
   \label{fig:alphacent:corr.gamma}
\end{figure}
%

Fig.~\ref{fig:alphacent:diff:RV} shows the comparison between the RV's retrieved using the SN shape and the ones obtained with the Normal shape. It is possible to appreciate the presence of a strong stellar activity signal, as expected \citep{Dumusque-2012,Thompson-2017}. When using SN mean RV, it is possible to observe more variations than the ones measured by the Normal fitting. This happens because the mean of the SN is more sensitive to stellar activity. In fact, because the SN includes an asymmetry parameter, SN mean RV gets more shifted in the direction of the asymmetry induced by stellar activity. On the other hand, when using SN median RV, smaller variations in RV are caused by changes in the asymmetry of the CCF, because this second location parameter is a more robust indicator than the mean. The bottom plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:alphacent:diff:RV} captures this aspect. Both indicators can be used to capture and summarise the different information available in the CCF, as will be shown in the remainder of this work.
%
\begin{figure*}[htbp]

(bottom) RV differences between Normal RV and SN mean RV (black circles) and between Normal RV and a SN median RV (cyan crosses).}
   \label{fig:alphacent:diff:RV}
\end{figure*}
%

Similar to \citet{Figueira-2013}, we compare the correlation between the different activity indicators and the RV's of the star in Fig.~\ref{fig:alphacent:corrPlot}. The correlation between $\gamma$ and SN mean RV and the correlation between $\gamma$ and SN median RV are much stronger than the correlations calculated between the other asymmetry parameters and their corresponding RV's. In particular the correlation between $\gamma$ and SN mean RV is almost twice the correlation between the other asymmetry parameters and their corresponding RV's.

Because the median is a more robust index than the mean, the correlation between $\gamma$ and SN median RV is not as large as the correlation between $\gamma$ and SN mean RV, but it is nonetheless $1.5$ times larger than the correlation between the other common asymmetry parameters and their corresponding RV's. In other words, changes in the asymmetry of the CCF are better captured when using the SN mean RV. The correlation between FWHM and the RV's, either by using SN mean RV or SN median RV, is as well stronger when fitting a SN distribution rather than a Normal. All the correlations are statistically different from $0$. Recalling the analyses presented in Sec. \ref{sec:soap}, we could infer that Alpha Centauri b is dominated by faculae, because the correlations between the RV's and the width of the CCF are strong (in particular the correlation between SN mean RV and SN FWHM is $0.817$).

Using Eq. \ref{eq:RV:correction}, we provide a new set of RV's corrected from stellar activity. The results are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:alphacent:correctionRV}. We see that, once corrected for stellar activity, the residuals in the Normal and SN analysis are comparable. However, we note that when using SN mean RV, the correction is more important. In fact, the comparison of $R^2$ shows that the SN fit accounts for a higher percentage of variability caused by stellar activity (i.e. spurious variations in RV's). We note also that the BIS SPAN is not helpful to address part of the spurious variability caused by stellar activity, while the opposite conclusion has reached when evaluating the p-value related to $\gamma$.

Both the proposed indicators coming from the SN distribution have advantages and limits: SN mean RV better catches changes in the asymmetry of the CCF but the resulting set of RV's ends up being contaminated by those spurious shifts caused by stellar activity that have been shortly presented in Sec. \ref{intro}. When using SN median RV, the final set of RV's is less affected by those spurious shifts caused by stellar activity, but at the same time this indicator is not able to catch as well as SN mean RV changes in the shape and in the width of the CCF. Once corrected from stellar activity using Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction}, the results are comparable. Anyway, both SN mean RV and SN median RV are useful to catch different aspects of the CCF and our suggestion is to use SN mean RV when interested in retrieving information about changes in the shape and/or the width of the CCF. In order to provide a set of RV's containing the smallest amount of spurious contamination imputable to stellar activity (i.e. before to run Eq.~\ref{eq:RV:correction}), our suggestion is to use instead SN median RV.

\section{Estimation of standard errors for the CCF parameters} \label{sec:5}

In this Section, we perform a bootstrap analysis \citep{davison1997bootstrap, efron1994introduction} in order to retrieve the standard errors associated to SN mean RV, SN median RV, RV, SN FWHM, FWHM, $\gamma$ and BIS SPAN. Because a CCF is obtained from a cross-correlation, each point in a CCF is correlated with each other. Therefore, we cannot do a bootstrap analysis on perturbing independently each CCF point with a Gaussian distribution scaled to the error of each given point. A detailed discussions of the methods nowadays available to resampling in situations with dependent data structures is available in \citet{lahiri2013resampling}. All the bootstrap methods that deal with dependant data structures rely on the so called Block Bootstrap methods, originally introduced by \citet{wilks1997resampling}. In our particular case, since each point in a CCF is correlated with each other, we bootstrap a hundred times the stellar spectrum given the photon-noise error of each wavelength and calculate for each realization a new CCF. We then fit a Normal or a SN distribution to each of these CCF's and then calculate the standard deviations of the distribution for the location parameters (RV, SN mean RV or SN median RV), the width parameters (SN FWHM or FWHM ) and the asymmetry parameters ($\gamma$ or BIS SPAN).

\subsection{Estimation of standard errors for the CCF parameters for the simulation study} \label{sec:bootstrap_soap}

We start by calculating the standard errors of the parameters retrieved in Sec. \ref{sec:soap}, where with SOAP we produced CCF's presenting spurious variations in RV's caused by a faculae or by a spot. In the third and final case we considered, beyond the spot, a planetary signal that produces pure Doppler-shifts in the CCF's.

Fig.~\ref{fig:se.soap.faculae} shows the results of the bootstrap analysis performed when a faculae is present on the photosphere of the star. The series of three plots in the top of Fig.~\ref{fig:se.soap.faculae} shows the different errors for the RV's, defined as RV (red triangles), SN mean RV (black circles) or SN median RV (cyan crosses), the width of the CCF, defined as FWHM (red triangles) or SN FWHM (black circles) and the asymmetry of the CCF, defined as SN GAMMA (black circles) or BIS SPAN (red triangles). In the series of three plots in the bottom of Fig.~\ref{fig:se.soap.faculae} we show the ratio between errors associated to the parameters derived from the bootstrap analysis fitting the SN and the errors associated to the parameters derived from the bootstrap analysis fitting the Normal distribution.  We used the same notation also for the other two cases, where respectively a spot is present on the photosphere of the star (Fig.~\ref{fig:se.soap.spot}) and a spot and a planet are introducing both spurious and pure variations in the RV's (Fig.~\ref{fig:se.soap.spot.planet}). Concerning the standard errors related to the RV's if a faculae is creating spurious signals, the ratio between the RV error measured by the bootstrap using the SN and Normal fitting is $1.4$, when using SN mean RV and $0.8$ when using SN median RV. By using SN median RV we get standard errors $20\%$ smaller than using the Normal fit and its corresponding mean. Regarding the errors in width of the CCF, we see that the bootstrap analysis for the Normal and the SN are comparable. Therefore, the precision in the width of the CCF is the comparable if we fit a Normal or a SN to the CCF. Finally, for the errors in evaluating the asymmetry of the CCF, we see that, when fitting the SN to the CCF, the asymmetry errors are $20\%$ smaller. Therefore, the SN fit gives a better precision in CCF asymmetry than what can be reached using BIS SPAN.

Fig.~\ref{fig:se.soap.spot} shows the results of the bootstrap analysis performed when a spot is present on the photosphere of the star.

Concerning the standard errors related to the RV's, the ratio between the RV error measured by the bootstrap using the SN and Normal fitting is $1.3$ when using SN mean RV and $0.8$ when using SN median RV. Regarding the errors in width of the CCF, we see that the bootstrap analysis for the Normal and the SN are comparable. Therefore, the precision in the width of the CCF is the comparable if we fit a Normal or a SN to the CCF. Finally, for the errors in evaluating the asymmetry of the CCF, we see that, when fitting the SN to the CCF, the asymmetry errors are $20\%$ smaller.

The ratio between the RV error measured by the bootstrap using the SN and Normal fitting is $1.3$ when using SN mean RV and $0.8$ when using SN median RV. The errors in width of the CCF are comparable and the errors in evaluating the asymmetry of the CCF are $15\%$ smaller when using the asymmetry parameter $\gamma$ of the SN.

\subsection{Estimation of standard errors for the CCF parameters for real stars} \label{sec:bootstrap_real_star}
In the top plots of Fig.~\ref{fig:se} we show the different errors for the RVs, either defined as RV (red triangles), SN mean RV (black circles) or SN median RV (cyan crosses), the width and the asymmetry of the CCFs for three star, HD215152, HD192310 and Corot-7, that are all at different SNR levels. The parameter SN50 corresponds to the SNR in order 50, which defines a wavelength of 550\,nm. In the bottom plots, we show the ratio between the parameters derived from the bootstrap analysis fitting the SN and the parameters derived from the bootstrap analysis fitting the Normal distribution. We first see that the errors on the CCF parameters only depends on the SNR and do not depend on the spectral type. This is true if the spectral type are not too different though, like here where we show the results for G and K dwarfs.

Concerning the standard errors related to the RVs, the ratio between the RV error measured by the bootstrap using the SN and Normal fitting is $1.6$ when using SN mean RV and $0.9$ when using SN median RV. In other words, by using SN median RV as parameter that defines the radial velocity of the star given a CCF, we get standard errors $10\%$ smaller than using the Normal fit and its corresponding mean. This result is consistent with what we observed with the simulation from SOAP presented in Sec. \ref{sec:soap}.

Regarding the errors in width of the CCF, we see that the bootstrap analysis for the Normal and the SN are comparable. Therefore, the precision in the width of the CCF is the comparable if we fit a Normal or a SN to the CCF.

Finally, for the errors in evaluating the asymmetry of the CCF, we see that, when fitting the SN to the CCF, the asymmetry errors are $15\%$ smaller. Therefore, the SN fit gives a better precision in CCF asymmetry than what can be reached using BIS SPAN. We recall moreover that, using the SN, all parameters are automatically retrieved in 1 single step, while in the common approach the RV and the BIS SPAN are calculated separately.

%Together with the pointwise estimates, retrieving the standard errors for the RVs of the star, $\gamma$ and the FWHM provides information about the uncertainties associated to each parameter. Since the procedure for retrieving the RVs of the star consists in fitting with a density function a CCF, getting the standard errors for all the parameter of interests cannot be done by using the common asymptotic theory. The implementation of a standard bootstrap analysis cannot as well be done, because the points of the CCF are highly correlated. In the analysis of the present work, in order to get the standard errors for the parameters of interest for a particular CCF, we moved each point of this CCF according to its measurement errors, producing $100$ simulated CCFs from the original one. Then we run both the Normal and the SN analyses on these simulated CCFs, letting us to retrieve an evaluation of the standard errors. This operation has been repeated for all the CCFs available for the analyzed stars. The comparison between the standard errors retrieved in this way with the classic noise parameter, {\color{red} obtained by using the Gray's equation cit. Gray (1983)} are presented in Fig.~ \ref{fig:se}.  {\color{red} Xavier: Is it correct how the noise parameter is obtained? Or it is simply $\sqrt(photons)$?}

%Given the strong correlation between the $\gamma$ parameter of the SN and its mean, the standard errors are larger respect the Normal fitting analysis. This fact confirms how correcting the RVs for stellar activity using Eq. \ref{eq:RV:correction} is more helpful when using the SN fitting. The standard errors for the FWHM are comparable for both the SN and the Normal analyses, whereas an improvement is clearly measurable for the standard errors associated to the asymmetry indicators. The last plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:se} shows that the standard errors for $\gamma$ are $10 \%$ smaller than the ones retrieved for the BIS SPAN.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discu}

An analysis of the CCF residuals after fitting a Normal or SN distribution shows that the SN is a slightly better model to explain the shape of the CCF. This comes from the fact that CCF's present a natural asymmetry due the convective blueshift.

We tested at first our assumptions by using simulated CCF's retrieved using the software SOAP 2.0. We then compared for five real stars the difference between the RV's (defined as mean of a Normal, mean of the SN or median of the SN), FWHM and asymmetry (BIS SPAN in the Normal case and $\gamma$ in the SN case). The $\gamma$ parameter is linearly dependent on the BIS SPAN, with always a strong correlation coefficient. 
%To compare $\gamma$, that do not have any units, with BIS SPAN expressed in \kms, one has simply to multiply $\gamma$ by the slope of the linear dependence between $\gamma$ and BIS SPAN. 
The slope of this linear correlation changes depending on the studied star. This is probably because the spectral type is different, therefore the effects from stellar activity are different.

When using as parameter for the RV the mean of the SN, the standard errors are in average $60\%$ larger than the standard errors retrieved fitting a Normal. However, once the RV is defined as the median of the SN (cyan crosses), the standard errors are in average $10\%$ smaller than the standard errors coming from the Normal fit. When looking at the correlation between the asymmetry and width parameters of the CCF (FWHM and BIS SPAN or the alternative indicators in \citet{Figueira-2013} in the Normal case, and SN FWHM and $\gamma$ in the SN case) with respect to the RV's (RV's in the Normal case or SN RV's in the SN case), we observe that the correlations are always stronger for the parameters of the SN. Therefore, the SN parameters are more sensitive to activity. In the case of Tau Ceti, which is at very low activity level, we find a significant correlation of $0.322$ between $\gamma$ and SN mean RV, while for all the other asymmetric parameterization, BIS SPAN or the alternative indicators in \citet{Figueira-2013}, the correlations are weaker with a maximum of 0.$225$.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclu}

In this paper we introduced a novel approach based on the Skew Normal (SN) distribution to retrieve RV's and shape variations in the CCF of stars. When searching for small-mass exoplanets using the RV technique, it is essential to understand variation of the shape of the CCF, which is a proxy for stellar activity effects. The standard approach consist at first to fit a Normal distribution to the CCF to get the RV and FWHM, defined as the mean and the FWHM of the Normal distribution, and then to measure the asymmetry of the CCF by calculating the BIS SPAN. FWHM and BIS SPAN give us information on the line shape that are used to probe stellar activity signals. 

In this paper we propose to conduct the analysis fitting a SN distribution to the CCF. Since the CCF presents a natural asymmetry due the convective blueshift, the SN distribution can in principle better catch these aspects respect the Normal fit. On top of that, by using the SN distribution to fit CCF's, we can measure simultaneously the RV of the star, the width and the asymmetry of the CCF.

Starting from the simulation environment SOAP and then moving to real stars, we showed that using the SN distribution to fit CCF's leads to a significant improvement to probing stellar activity. While for the Normal distribution mean and median are equivalent, using the SN fit different location parameters can be tested. While the median of the SN is a more robust statistic respect variations in the shape of the CCF, the mean of the SN is more sensible to changes in the asymmetry of the CCF. We suggest to use as parameter that defines the RV of the star the median of the SN, since the standard errors related to this parameter working with CCF's from real stars are on average $10\%$ smaller than the standard errors retrieved using the Normal distribution. To evaluate changes in the asymmetry of the CCF, we suggest to use the mean of the SN. The correlation between SN mean RV and SN FWHM and the correlation between SN mean RV and $\gamma$ (the asymmetry parameter of the SN) are much stronger than the correlations between the equivalent parameters derived using a Normal fit (RV, FWHM and BIS SPAN or the asymmetric parameters described in \citet{Figueira-2013}). The precision on the asymmetry measured by $\gamma$ is greater than the one on BIS SPAN by $\sim$15\%. Therefore when searching for rotational periods in the data, or applying Gaussian Processes to account for stellar activity signals, the SN parameters should be used.

Because of stellar activity the estimated RV's are contaminated by spurious variations. We propose to use a function that corrects from stellar activity that beyond the width and the asymmetry parameters of the CCF includes also the contrast parameter A and the fourth parameter defined as the interaction between width and the asymmetry parameters of the CCF. We found these new two parameter helpful to explain part of the spurious variations in RV's caused by stellar activity.

Finally, we also encourage the use of bootstrapping to estimate more realistic errors on the different parameters of the Normal or SN fitted to the CCF, mainly in the low SNR regime where a gain of 50\% can be reached. This takes significantly more time, but note that 100 bootstrapped dataset are enough to get a good estimation of errors.


%the RVs of the star can be calculated as the mean of the SN, whereas its asymmetry parameter $\gamma$ can be naturally used for retrieving information about the asymmetry of the CCF. Because of the natural correlation between the RVs and the asymmetry parameter, a linear combination of both $\gamma$ and the FWHM has been implemented for correcting the RVs from stellar activity, allowing us to retrieve a more precise RVs. 

%In order to get the standard errors for the estimated parameters, rather than using the common $noise$ statistic, we created a simulated procedure based on perturbing each point of the CCF according to its measurement error. Then, by getting from the original profile line $100$ simulated profiles, we run the SN fitting analyses, allowing us retrieving for all the parameter of interests an estimation for their standard errors. Concerning the standard error associated to the means of the distributions, the SN fit leads to slightly larger standard errors respect when running the Normal fit. This fact can be explained by noticing that as a simulated CCF is created according to the procedure described above, we expect slightly differences on the asymmetry of the CCF as well. The natural correlation between the RVs of the star and $\gamma$, where the mean of the SN is shifted in the direction of the asymmetry of the distribution, leads to larger uncertainties related to the RVs of the star. The latter consideration provides a further justification for correcting the RVs of the star from stellar activity and explains why this correction is more helpful when running the proposed analysis rather than the classic Normal fit. Concerning the standard errors related to the asymmetry parameters, when using the SN fit the uncertainties are $10 \%$ smaller than using the classic BIS SPAN. In conclusion, we showed how using the SN fit provides in an unique step a better understanding of the stellar activity through using the asymmetry parameter $\gamma$ rather than using the common statistics such as the BIS SPAN or other indicators. On top of that, when focusing on low signal-to-noise cases, the SN procedure showed how statistically significant results are retrieved with the proposed approach in terms of correlation between the asymmetry of the profile line and the RVs, whereas for the previous analyses this correlation does not result statistically significant.

\section{Appendix} \label{appendix}

In this Appendix we present the analyses conducted on other 4 stars: HD192310, HD10700, HD215152 and finally Corot-7. 

\umberto{Add further information about the stars here presented.}\xavier{}

Table \ref{table:summaryStars} summarizes the results obtained by the SN fit and the some of the results based on the Normal fit. The results are all consistent with the conclusions derived by the analyses on Alpha Centauri b. The correlation between $\gamma$ and SN mean RV is stronger than the correlation between the BIS SPAN and RV for all the considered stars. The correlation between SN FWHM and SN mean RV is stronger than the correlation between FWHM and RV for three of the four stars.  Also for all these stars we corrected the originally estimated RV's from spurious variations in RV's caused by stellar activity, using Eq. \ref{eq:RV:correction}. Fig. \ref{fig:HD192310:correctionRV}--\ref{fig:HD215152:correctionRV} show the resulting corrected RV's. While the Normal and SN residuals, once corrected for stellar activity, are comparable for the stars $\text{HD}192310$ and $\text{HD}10700$, the results of the analyses on the star $\text{HD}215152$ (whose CCF's have lower SNR respect to the previous two analyzed stars) suggest that the residuals for the Normal are $0.054 \ms$ higher than the residuals retrieved with the SN analysis. Finally, the results of the analysis on $\text{Corot }7$, whose CCF's have lowest SNR, show that once corrected from stellar activity the residuals from the Normal fit are $0.336 \ms$ higher than the residuals retrieved with the SN analysis.
