\newlabel{fig:se}{{17}{31}{Comparison between the standard errors using the bootstrap analysis for the RVs, the FWHM and the asymmetry parameter. When using SN mean RV (black circles), the standard errors are in average $60\%$ larger than the standard errors retrieved fitting a Normal (red triangles). However, if using SN median RV (cyan crosses), the standard errors are in average $10\%$ smaller than the standard errors coming from the Normal fit. To use as asymmetry parameter $\gamma $ of the SN leads to standard errors in average $15\%$ smaller than the standard errors related to the BIS SPAN.
