	Abstract = {Context. Stellar activity patterns are responsible for jitter effects that are observed at different timescales and amplitudes in the measurements obtained from photometric and spectroscopic time series observations. These effects are currently in the focus of many exoplanet search projects, since the lack of a well-defined characterization and correction strategy hampers the detection of the signals associated with small exoplanets.  Aims: Accurate simulations of the stellar photosphere based on the most recent available models for main-sequence stars can provide synthetic photometric and spectroscopic time series data. These may help to investigate the relation between activity jitter and stellar parameters when considering different active region patterns. Moreover, jitters can be analysed at different wavelength scales (defined by the passbands of given instruments or space missions) to design strategies to remove or minimize them.  Methods: We present the StarSim tool, which is based on a model for a spotted rotating photosphere built from the integration of the spectral contribution of a fine grid of surface elements. The model includes all significant effects affecting the flux intensities and the wavelength of spectral features produced by active regions and planets. The resulting synthetic time series data generated with this simulator were used to characterize the effects of activity jitter in extrasolar planet measurements from photometric and spectroscopic observations.  Results: Several cases of synthetic data series for Sun-like stars are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the methodology. A specific application for characterizing and modelling the spectral signature of active regions is considered, showing that the chromatic effects of faculae are dominant for low-temperature contrasts of spots. Synthetic multi-band photometry and radial velocity time series are modelled for HD 189733 by adopting the known system parameters and fitting for the map of active regions with StarSim. Our algorithm reproduces both the photometry and the radial velocity (RV) curves to good precision, generally better than the studies published to date. We evaluate the RV signature of the activity in HD 189733 by exploring a grid of solutions from the photometry. We find that the use of RV data in the inverse problem could break degeneracies and allow for a better determination of some stellar and activity parameters, for example, the configuration of active regions, the temperature contrast of spots, and the amount of faculae. In addition, the effects of spots are studied for a set of simulated transit photometry, showing that these can introduce variations in Rp/R* measurements with a spectral signature and amplitude that are very similar to the signal of an atmosphere dominated by dust.},

@article{Dumusque:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Stellar activity is the main limitation to the detection of Earth-twins using the RV technique. Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of stellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we are facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using current techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive precise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution spectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all observations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative to it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each line as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed with HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones derived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs demonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces night-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose a solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the most astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some spectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not. By measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we demonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6 the red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By measuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV precision as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows to demonstrate that each line is differently affected by stellar activity. Preliminary results show that studying in details the behaviour of each spectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity.},

@article{Bouchy:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Two years ago, the OGLE-III survey (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) announced the detection of54short period multi-transiting objects in the Galactic bulge (Udalski etal. [CITE],b). Some of these objects were considered to be potential hot Jupiters. In order to determine the true nature of these objects and to characterize their actual mass, we conducted a radial velocity follow-up of 18 of the smallest transiting candidates. We describe here our procedure and report the characterization of 8low-mass star-transiting companions, 2grazing eclipsing binaries, 2triple systems, 1confirmed exoplanet (OGLE-TR-56b), 1possible exoplanet (OGLE-TR-10b), 1clear false positive and 3unsolved cases. The variety of cases encountered in our follow-up covers a large part of the possible scenarios occurring in the search for planetary transits. As a by-product our program yields precise masses and radii of low mass stars.  Based on observations collected with the UVES and FLAMES spectrographs at the VLT/UT2 Kueyen telescope (Paranal Observatory, ESO, Chile: program 70.C-0209 and 71.C-0251).},

	Abstract = {Stellar inclination is an important parameter for many astrophysical studies. Although different techniques allow us to estimate stellar inclination for fast rotators, it becomes much more difficult when stars are rotating slower than ~2-2.5 km s--1. By using the new activity simulation SOAP 2.0 which can reproduce the photometric and spectroscopic variations induced by stellar activity, we are able to fit observations of solar-type stars and derive their inclination. For HD 189733, we estimate the stellar inclination to be i=84+6-20 deg, which implies a star-planet obliquity of \psi =4+18-4 considering previous measurements of the spin-orbit angle. For alpha Cen B, we derive an inclination of i=45+9-19, which implies that the rotational spin of the star is not aligned with the orbital spin of the alpha Cen binary system. In addition, assuming that alpha Cen Bb is aligned with its host star, no transit would occur. The inclination of alpha Cen B can be measured using 40 radial-velocity measurements, which is remarkable given that the projected rotational velocity of the star is smaller than 1.15 km s--1.  Based on observations made with the MOST satellite, the HARPS instrument on the ESO 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory (Chile), and the SOPHIE instrument at the Observatoire de Haute Provence (France).},

	Abstract = {We explore the feasibility of detecting Earth analogs around Sun-like stars using the radial velocity method by investigating one of the largest radial velocities datasets for the one of the most stable radial-velocity stars HD20794. We proceed by disentangling the Keplerian signals from correlated noise and activity-induced variability. We diagnose the noise using the differences between radial velocities measured at different wavelength ranges, so-called "differential radial velocities". We apply this method to the radial velocities measured by HARPS, and identify four signals at 18, 89, 147 and 330 d. The two signals at periods of 18 and 89 d are previously reported and are better quantified in this work. The signal at a period of about 147 d is reported for the first time, and corresponds to a super-Earth with a minimum mass of 4.59 Earth mass located 0.51 AU from HD20794. We also find a significant signal at a period of about 330 d corresponding to a super-Earth or Neptune in the habitable zone. Since this signal is close to the annual sampling period and significant periodogram power in some noise proxies are found close to this signal, further observations and analyses are required to confirm it. The analyses of the eccentricity and consistency of signals provide weak evidence for the existence of the previously reported 43 d signal and a new signal at a period of about 11.9 d with a semi amplitude of 0.4 m/s. We find that the detection of a number of signals with radial velocity variations around 0.5\,m/s likely caused by low mass planet candidates demonstrates the important role of noise modeling in searching for Earth analogs.},

	Abstract = {The M dwarf star Gliese 581 is believed to host four planets, including one (GJ 581d) near the habitable zone that could possibly support liquid water on its surface if it is a rocky planet. The detection of another habitable-zone planet---GJ 581g---is disputed, as its significance depends on the eccentricity assumed for d. Analyzing stellar activity using the Halpha line, we measure a stellar rotation period of 130 $\pm$ 2 days and a correlation for Halpha modulation with radial velocity. Correcting for activity greatly diminishes the signal of GJ 581d (to 1.5 standard deviations) while significantly boosting the signals of the other known super-Earth planets. GJ 581d does not exist, but is an artifact of stellar activity which, when incompletely corrected, causes the false detection of planet g.},

	Abstract = {The Automated Planet Finder (APF) is a facility purpose-built for the discovery and characterization of extrasolar planets through high-cadence Doppler velocimetry of the reflex barycentric accelerations of their host stars. Located atop Mt. Hamilton, the APF facility consists of a 2.4-m telescope and its Levy spectrometer, an optical echelle spectrometer optimized for precision Doppler velocimetry. APF features a fixed format spectral range from 374 nm - 970 nm, and delivers a "Throughput" (resolution * slit width product) of 114,000 arc-seconds, with spectral resolutions up to 150,000. Overall system efficiency (fraction of photons incident on the primary mirror that are detected by the science CCD) on blaze at 560 nm in planet-hunting mode is 15%. First-light tests on the RV standard stars HD 185144 and HD 9407 demonstrate sub-meter per second precision (RMS per observation) held over a 3-month period. This paper reviews the basic features of the telescope, dome, and spectrometer, and gives a brief summary of first-light performance.},

@article{Claret-2011,
	Abstract = {Aims: The complex physics of close binary stars is made even more challenging by the proximity effects that affect it. Understanding the influence of these proximity effects is one of the most important tasks in theoretical stellar astrophysics. It is crucial to know how the specific intensity is distributed over the stellar disk for a correct modelling of the light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits. To provide theoretical input for light curve modelling codes, we present new calculations of gravity- and limb-darkening coefficients for a wide range of effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and microturbulent velocities.  Methods: We computed limb-darkening coefficients for several atmosphere models, which cover the transmission curves of the Kepler, CoRoT, and Spitzer space missions as well as more widely used passbands (Str{\"o}mgren, Johnson-Cousins, Sloan). In addition to these computations, which were made adopting the least-square method, we also performed calculations for the bi-parametric approximations by adopting the flux conservation method to provide users with an additional tool to estimate the theoretical error bars. To facilitate the modelling of the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the gravity-darkening coefficients y(lambda) using the same models of stellar atmospheres as for the limb-darkening. Compared to previous work, a more general differential equation was used, which now takes into account local gravity variations and the effects of convection.  Results: The limb-darkening coefficients were computed with a higher numerical resolution (100 mu points instead of 15 or 17, as is often used in the ATLAS models), and five equations were used to describe the specific intensities (linear, quadratic, root-square, logarithmic, and a 4-coefficient law). Concerning the gravity-darkening coefficients, the influence of the local gravity on y(lambda) is shown as well as the effects of convection, which turn out to be very significant for cool stars. The results are tabulated for log g's ranging from 0.0 to 5.0, -5.0 <= log [M/H] <= +1, 2000 K <= Teff <= 50 000 K and for five values of the microturbulent velocity. ATLAS and PHOENIX plane-parallel atmosphere models were used for all computations.},

Tests of the code are presented to illustrate its performance and to validate its capability when compared with analytical models and real data. Finally, we apply SOAP-T to the active star, HAT-P-11, observed by the NASA Kepler space telescope and use this system to discuss the capability of this tool in analyzing light curves for the cases where the transiting planet overlaps with the star's spots.

	Abstract = {The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a common tool in the frequency analysis of unequally spaced data equivalent to least-squares fitting of sine waves. We give an analytic solution for the generalisation to a full sine wave fit, including an offset and weights (chi2 fitting). Compared to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the generalisation is superior as it provides more accurate frequencies, is less susceptible to aliasing, and gives a much better determination of the spectral intensity. Only a few modifications are required for the computation and the computational effort is similar. Our approach brings together several related methods that can be found in the literature, viz. the date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, the floating-mean periodogram, and the ``spectral significance'' estimator used in the SigSpec program, for which we point out some equivalences. Furthermore, we present an algorithm that implements this generalisation for the evaluation of the Keplerian periodogram that searches for the period of the best-fitting Keplerian orbit to radial velocity data. The systematic and non-random algorithm is capable of detecting eccentric orbits, which is demonstrated by two examples and can be a useful tool in searches for the orbital periods of exoplanets.},

	Abstract = {Stellar activity can induce signals in the radial velocities of stars, complicating the detection of orbiting low-mass planets. We present a method to determine the number of planetary signals present in radial-velocity datasets of active stars, using only radial-velocity observations. Instead of considering separate fits with different number of planets, we use a birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to infer the posterior distribution for the number of planets in a single run. In a natural way, the marginal distributions for the orbital parameters of all planets are also inferred. This method is applied to HARPS data of CoRoT-7.

@article{Borgniet-2015,
	Abstract = {Context. Stellar activity induced by active structures such as stellar spots and faculae is known to have a strong impact on the radial velocity (RV) time series. It is therefore a strong limitation to the detection of small planetary RV signals, such as that of an Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone of a solar-like star. In a series of previous papers, we have studied the detectability of such planets around the Sun observed as a star in an edge-on configuration. For this purpose, we computed the RV, photometric and astrometric variations induced by solar magnetic activity, using all active structures observed over one entire cycle.  Aims: Our goal is to perform similar studies on stars with different physical and geometrical properties. As a first step, we focus on Sun-like stars seen with various inclinations, and on estimating detection capabilities with future instruments.  Methods: To do so, we first parameterize the solar active structures with the most realistic pattern so as to obtain results consistent with the observed ones. We simulate the growth, evolution and decay of solar magnetic features (spots, faculae and network), using parameters and empiric laws derived from solar observations and literature. We generate the corresponding structure lists over a full solar cycle. We then build the resulting spectra and deduce the RV and photometric variations, first in the case of a sun seen edge-on and then with various inclinations. The produced RV signal takes into account the photometric contribution of spots and faculae as well as the attenuation of the convective blueshift in faculae. We then use these patterns to study solar-like stars with various inclinations.  Results: The comparison between our simulated activity pattern and the observed pattern validates our model. We show that the inclination of the stellar rotation axis has a significant impact on the photometric and RV time series. Radial velocity long-term amplitudes and short-term jitters are significantly reduced when going from edge-on to pole-on configurations. Assuming spin-orbit alignment, the best configuration for planet detection is an inclined star (i ~= 45$\,^{\circ}$).},

	Abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of four super-Earth planets around HD 215152, with orbital periods of 5.76, 7.28, 10.86, and 25.2 d, and minimum masses of 1.8, 1.7, 2.8, and 2.9 M⊕ respectively. This discovery is based on 373 high-quality radial velocity measurements taken by HARPS over 13 yr. Given the low masses of the planets, the signal-to-noise ratio is not sufficient to constrain the planet eccentricities. However, a preliminary dynamical analysis suggests that eccentricities should be typically lower than about 0.03 for the system to remain stable. With two pairs of planets with a period ratio lower than 1.5, with short orbital periods, low masses, and low eccentricities, HD 215152 is similar to the very compact multi-planet systems found by Kepler, which is very rare in radial-velocity surveys. This discovery proves that these systems can be reached with the radial-velocity technique, but characterizing them requires a huge amount of observations.

	Abstract = {The removal of noise typically correlated in time and wavelength is one of the main challenges for using the radial-velocity (RV) method to detect Earth analogues. We analyze tau Ceti RV data and find robust evidence for wavelength-dependent noise. We find that this noise can be modeled by a combination of moving average models and the so-called ``differential radial velocities.'' We apply this noise model to various RV data sets for tau Ceti, and find four periodic signals at 20.0, 49.3, 160, and 642 days, which we interpret as planets. We identify two new signals with orbital periods of 20.0 and 49.3 days while the other two previously suspected signals around 160 and 600 days are quantified to a higher precision. The 20.0 days candidate is independently detected in Keck data. All planets detected in this work have minimum masses less than 4{M}\oplus  with the two long-period ones located around the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone, respectively. We find that the instrumental noise gives rise to a precision limit of the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) around 0.2 m s-1. We also find correlation between the HARPS data and the central moments of the spectral line profile at around 0.5 m s-1 level, although these central moments may contain both noise and signals. The signals detected in this work have semi-amplitudes as low as 0.3 m s-1, demonstrating the ability of the RV technique to detect relatively weak signals.},

	Abstract = {Context. In 2009 we started an intense radial-velocity monitoring of a few nearby, slowly-rotating and quiet solar-type stars within the dedicated HARPS-Upgrade GTO program.  Aims: The goal of this campaign is to gather very-precise radial-velocity data with high cadence and continuity to detect tiny signatures of very-low-mass stars that are potentially present in the habitable zone of their parent stars.  Methods: Ten stars were selected among the most stable stars of the original HARPS high-precision program that are uniformly spread in hour angle, such that three to four of them are observable at any time of the year. For each star we recorded 50 data points spread over the observing season. The data points consist of three nightly observations with a total integration time of 10 min each and are separated by two hours. This is an observational strategy adopted to minimize stellar pulsation and granulation noise.  Results: We present the first results of this ambitious program. The radial-velocity data and the orbital parameters of five new and one confirmed low-mass planets around the stars HD 20794, HD 85512, and HD 192310 are reported and discussed, among which is a system of three super-Earths and one that harbors a 3.6 M⊕-planet at the inner edge of the habitable zone.  Conclusions: This result already confirms previous indications that low-mass planets seem to be very frequent around solar-type stars and that this may occur with a frequency higher than 30\%.  Based on observations made with the HARPS instrument on ESO's 3.6 m telescope at the La Silla Observatory in the frame of the HARPS-Upgrade GTO program ID 086.C-0230.Tables 7-9 (RV data) are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/534/A58},
