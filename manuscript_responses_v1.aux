From top to bottom, we can see the CCF RV, the CCF asymmetry and the CCF width. Phase 0 correspond to the spot on the center of the visible hemisphere, In total, there is 100 simulated measurement, from phase -0.5 to 0.5. \emph  {Bottom:} Correlation between SN FWHM and SN mean RV. The number around each circle corresponds to stellar rotation phase. Numbers goes from 0 to 100, which corresponds to phase -0.5 to 0.5.}}{4}}
